# Web Interface for Execution Logs

This documentation outlines the features and functionality of the **ExecutionLens** web interface, which interacts with API execution logs. The interface is designed to improve debugging, performance tracking, and system analysis.

## Key Features

1. **Search Logs**
   - Allows users to search logs by criteria such as API endpoint, request parameters, execution time, exceptions, or time range.
   
2. **Trigger Execution Reproduction**
   - Provides the ability to trigger the reproduction of logged API executions directly from the interface.
   - Useful for debugging by replaying the exact flow of a previous execution.

3. **Generate Sequence Diagrams**
   - Automatically creates sequence diagrams for visualizing the flow of the API execution.
   - Helps in understanding method calls, request/response flows, and interactions between services.
   
4. **Charts and Analytics**
   - Visual representation of execution times, the number of requests, and exceptions.
   - Includes:
     - **Execution Time Distribution**: Visualize average, maximum, and minimum execution times across requests.
     - **Request Volume**: Track the number of requests over a period.
     - **Exception Rate**: Monitor and analyze exceptions raised in API executions.
